      text: "I was born in Mucuchachí, Mérida state – Venezuela, in 1943, when the mountain winds still carried echoes of a distant war and my mother wrapped me in tales of mist, wheat, and hope. This Andean town, founded in 1770 on ancestral lands of the Timotes and Mucuchíes, gave me more than a place: it gave me roots.",

    identity: {
      text: "My name is María Tibisay Gómez, daughter of Dominga, granddaughter of Cantalicia, great-granddaughter of a woman whose name is not written in any book, but who lives in every arepa my hands knead. In the Mérida Andes, where corn doesn't thrive in the cold and altitude, wheat found a home, brought by Augustinian friars in the 16th century. And with it, a new way to nourish the soul was born: the wheat arepa.",

    learning: {
      text: "I was six years old when my grandmother taught me how to make it. It was 1949, wheat arrived in worn sacks from Timotes or Lagunillas, and we ground it with stones that still hold the echo of time.",
