    section1: {
      title: "A Story of Tradition",
      text: "I am Tibisay Gómez. I was born in Mucuchachi (Venezuela) in 1942, when the mountain wind still carried echoes of the distant war and my mother wrapped me in tales of mist and wheat. This town, founded in 1770 by David de la Peña on lands that once belonged to the Timotes and Mucuchíes, is my root, my blood, my flour.",
    },
    section2: {
      title: "A Family Legacy",
      text: "The recipe is not mine: I inherited it from my mother, Dominga, who in turn inherited it from my grandmother Cantalicia; and she, from a great-grandmother with no name written in any book, but engraved in the Andean soul. In the Andes of Mérida, where corn drowns in the cold and altitude, wheat arrived with the Spanish in the 1500s, brought by Augustinian friars who sowed doctrine and seeds in valleys like ours.",
    },
    section3: {
      title: "The Art of Kneading",
      text: "I remember the day my grandmother taught me: I, at 6 years old, with legs thin as willow rods. It was 1948 and the post-war had brought scarcity. Wheat arrived in worn sacks from the farms of Timotes or Lagunillas, but in Mucuchachi we ground it ourselves with stones that still hold the echo of prehistoric drums.",
    },
    section4: {
      title: "Ancestral Wisdom",
      text: '"My dear," Cantalicia would tell me, with her hands wrinkled like maps of the mountains, "the arepa cannot be rushed: it is kneaded with the heart, flattened with patience, and browned until it sings."',
    },
    section5: {
      title: "More than Food",
      text: "The wheat arepa is not just food: it is the voice of my grandmothers, the cold that is fought with the warmth of firewood, the bread that unites a town when words fail. Come, try one. Split it in half like opening an ancient book, bite and listen: in each crumb there is a whisper from the Andes, a heartbeat of Mucuchachi, and the name of Tibisay Gómez, guardian of a legacy that will not die as long as there is flour, water, and memory.",
